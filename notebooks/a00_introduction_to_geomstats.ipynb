    "Dear Learner,\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome. This is a set of notebooks designed to teach you how to use (and hopefully understand) a software package called Geomstats. Geomstats is an open source code that uses Riemannian Geometry concepts to analyze data that lie on manifolds (this will be explained in further detail in the next section). Geomstats is the first software package of its kind. Before Geomstats, analysis of data on manifolds could only be done by people who could write their own software that could implement Riemannian geometry to analyze data on manifolds. The Geomstats package opens this field up and makes this type of data analysis more accessible to people who do not have prior knowledge of Riemannian Geometry. "

    "The number of Degrees of Freedom a system has is the number of variables needed to describe the system completely. For example, an object moving freely in three dimensions will require three variables to describe it completely (x,y,z), ($\\phi,\\theta,$ r). If you can describe an object's motion in three dimensions, you would not want to use four variables to describe its motion because keeping track of another variable is mentally taxing (if you are solving a problem on paper) and more computationally expensive (if you are solving the problem with a computer). Therefore, if you had the ability to solve the problem using fewer degrees of freedom, you would want to do it. If you now know that this free particle is moving on the surface of a sphere, you would want to analyze the particle using two varibles $(\\theta,\\phi)$."
