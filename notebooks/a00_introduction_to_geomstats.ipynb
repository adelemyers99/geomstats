    "Dear Learner,\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome. This is a set of notebooks designed to teach you how to use (and hopefully understand) a software package called Geomstats. Geomstats is an open source code that uses Riemannian Geometry concepts to analyze data that lie on manifolds (this will be explained in further detail in the next section). Geomstats is the first software package of its kind. Before Geomstats, analysis of data on manifolds could only be done by people who could write their own software that could implement Riemannian geometry to analyze data on manifolds. The Geomstats package opens this field up and makes this type of data analysis more accessible to people who do not have prior knowledge of Riemannian Geometry. "
