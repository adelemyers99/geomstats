In general terms, the connection $\\nabla_{\\vec{u}} \\vec{v}$ is a mathematical concept which tells you how much vector $\\vec{v}$ would change if you moved it an infinitesimal distance in the direction of vector $\\vec{u}$. Before we define the connection in more precise terms, we will first have to define  $\\textbf{tangent spaces}$ and $\\textbf{parallel vector fields}$."

Before you can understand exactly what this second definition means, we will first have to discuss what a tangent space is and what parallelism is."
